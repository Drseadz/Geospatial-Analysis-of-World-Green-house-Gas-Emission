# Geospatial-Analysis-of-World-Green-house-Gas-Emission

This notebook focus on geospatial analysis of green house gas emission indicated in Kilotonnes of CO2. 

Analysis and visualization will be done using geopandas and matplotlib on Jupyter notebook. The analysis will focus majorly on the emissions in countries around the world from 2000 to 2010 and visualize them. 

Percentage change in green house emissions from 2000 to 2010 and the corellation between mean population and mean green house emission will be analysed and visualized.
